<h1>About Me</h1>


  <p>I am a passionate and detail-oriented Radiographer with a strong background in medical imaging and patient care. My work in radiography has equipped me with precision, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work under pressure — qualities that naturally extend to my other professional interests. With years of hands-on experience in diagnostic imaging, I take pride in contributing to accurate diagnoses and improved health outcomes.</p>


  <p>Beyond healthcare, I am also a skilled Web Developer, blending creativity with technical expertise to build functional and user-friendly websites. I enjoy crafting digital experiences that not only look great but perform seamlessly across platforms. From front-end design to back-end development, I bring a holistic approach to web projects, continuously learning and adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>


  <p>In addition to my clinical and tech pursuits, I am an active Blogger who loves sharing insights, tutorials, and personal thoughts with a growing online audience. Whether I’m writing about health, technology, or everyday experiences, my goal is to inform, inspire, and connect with readers across the globe. My diverse skill set helps me bridge the gap between science, technology, and storytelling.</p>
